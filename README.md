I'm Parsa, a CS Master's student at Concordia University. Currently, I'm researching applied **Machine Learning** and **Reinforcement Learning** for solving real-world problems, particularly in the field of **Computer Networks**. Check my [webpage](https://procedurally-generated-human.github.io/) or [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RkgCgz0AAAAJ&hl=en) for more information.

The majority of my repositories consist of interesting projects that I have worked on during my free time as well as some school-related code.

My research interests:
- Machine/Deep Learning 
- Reinforcement Learning (applied, theoretical, model-based, ...)
- Computer Networks (routing, resource allocation, SDN, VNF, security, ...)
- Internet of Things
