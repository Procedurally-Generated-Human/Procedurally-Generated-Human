I'm Parsa, a fourth-year Computer Engineering student. Currently, I'm researching applied **Machine Learning** and **Reinforcement Learning** for solving real-world problems, particularly in the field of **computer networks**. Check my [webpage](https://procedurally-generated-human.github.io/) or [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RkgCgz0AAAAJ&hl=en) for more information.

The majority of my repositories consist of interesting projects that I have worked on during my free time as well as some school-related code.

My research interests:
- Machine/Deep Learning 
- Reinforcement Learning (Applied, Theoretical, Model-based, ...)
- Computer Networks (Routing, Resource Allocation, SDN, VNF, Security, ...)
- Internet of Things
- Computer Vision
