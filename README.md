I'm Parsa, a third year Computer Engineering student. Currently, I'm researching applied Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning for solving real-world problems.
The majority of my repositories consist of interesting projects that i have worked on during my free time as well as some school related code.    

Current Interests:
- Machine Learning
- Reinforcement Learning
- Genetic Algorithims
- Procedural Generation
- Backend Development
