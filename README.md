I'm Parsa, a sophomore studying Computer Engineering at Razi university.  

The majority of my repositories are small to medium scale projects that i work on during my free time.  
After working on a lot of different projects in quite a few different fields, these are currently the subjects in which i have the most interest/experience in:   
- Genetic Algorithms
- Machine Learning Models
- Backend Development
- Procedural Generation
- Encryption/Steganography
